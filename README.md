# Andrews-Webpage
This is a personal website to show my learning history and projects I've created over time.

In order to keep track of my history over time, and to almost act as a journal, I will use this
website to cement my current knowledge and document my findings. I will add new pages and paragraphs
to the home-page, and update the style to the best of my abilities.
