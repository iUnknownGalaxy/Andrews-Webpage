        <!-- Start off website with classic "Hello World" add more elements later -->

        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <p>
            The beginnings of every journey start with a first step. Like most people, 
            I want to start by running. As my first <strong>assignment</strong> I am tasked
            with designing the beginnings of a blog. I just used the <em>"strong"</em> 
            element to make things bold. See what I did there too? I also used the 
            <em>"em"</em> element to italicize.
        </p>

        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>
            I'm not entirely sure who will be reading this in the future, but the website 
            will look completely different than the barebones look it currently possesses. 
            I encourage you to keep an eye out for future changes. Perhaps you could even
            be a part of that change.
        </p>

        <h2>Studying Links and Lists</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="./pages/list.html">Here</a> is a link to the lists I created earlier 
            today. In order to create this relative link, I added an <em>href</em> to the
            anchor &lt;a&gt; element. This hyperlink reference (./pages/list.html) basically 
            says, in the current directory, look for the "pages" directory, and then link to
            the file "list.html". Who knew HTML could be so interesting!
        </p>

        <h2>Studying CSS and What Exactly is a DOM?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="../odin-recipes/index.html">Here</a> is a link to my recipes document!
            It includes a bunch of things, such as lists, a little bit of CSS, and buttons.
            Practice, practice, and more practice is the name of the game if you want to get
            better at something, so that's been my goal. More importantly, I learned what the
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-dom/">DOM</a> (Document 
            Object Model) is, and what it actually means in terms of web developement. It's
            essentially an organized set of instructions for a browser to follow, but it's also
            great at providing a way to see the relationship between objects on a webpage and 
            how they interact with one another.

        <h2>More CSS and the Box Model</h2>
        <p>
            Today I changed up the way everything is spaced out on 2 of my webpages in order
            to give myself some practice with margins and padding. I felt borders are pretty
            self-explanatory so I didn't add any to the website. Although everything looks
            ugly in its current stage, my main goal is just to practice, so I have to keep
            it in mind that what I'm doing is totally fine. I'm not going to lie to you though.
            seeing everything in its current stage is pretty disheartening. I want so bad to
            make everything look pretty. Getting down the basics is of upmost importance though,
            so testing more properties of different elements will be much more helpful than a 
            pretty website. 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">
            This</a> is a pretty handy tool for testing out and playing with the box model!
        </p>

        <h2>Inline vs Inline-Block</h2>
        <p>
            I'm learning more about blocks and inline elements today! 
            <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block">
            This</a> webpage gives clear examples to what properties change using the different
            display elements. Essentially, inline elements start on the same line as the other 
            things it is around, such as this <span class="inline">span</span> element. It will 
            ONLY take up as much width and height as its content, but changing the padding property 
            could cause it to overflow onto the things around it. If you did want to change height 
            and width, but continue on the same line then changing the display property to inline-
            block might be beneficial. Here is another <span class="inline-block">span</span> 
            element, but this time the display property is inline-block and the height, width and 
            padding properties are adjusted.
        </p>

        <h2>Flexbox</h2>
        <p>
            There's a lot to unpack today, but the main jist of things is that flexbox is an intuitive
            way of organizing boxes in a container. In order to create a flexbox, simply create a
            parent container of display: flex;, and inside of that create the container's children, each
            being the same class as each other, like so:
            <div class="parent">
                <div class="child">one child</div>
                <div class="child">two child</div>
                <div class="child">three child</div>
            </div>
            Unfortunately, with my current skills, I'm unable to demonstrate what collapsing or expanding
            the parent container would do, but <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">this</a> fun game
            allows you to see what you can do to the items in the container.
